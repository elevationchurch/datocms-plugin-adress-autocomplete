This plugin is a React-based implementation of Google's [Address Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-autocomplete) API, for [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/).

## Prerequisites

First off, you'll need to obtain an [API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) from Google Cloud. This README won't cover those steps, but here's a friendly reminder that you will need to enable to following Google Cloud services in order for it to work:

- Maps JavaScript API
- Places API
